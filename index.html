            <p>The <b>colored rooms</b> will be removed, since I’m changing the room concept. Before, this idea was heavily inspired by <b>VVVVVV</b>, but I realized that colored rooms no longer make sense for the game.
            Now there will be only <b>one room</b>, which will be <b>gray</b>.</p>

            <p>Changes to the game’s concept.
            The game will now focus on the player going through each room individually. It will still keep the idea of <b>colored rooms</b>, but it will no longer follow the room structure seen in <b>VVVVVV</b>.
            This change happened by chance, as I realized it would be more interesting to design the game this way instead of creating a single giant room.</p>

            <p>I’ve just uploaded the game’s <b>DevLog website</b> to my <b>GitHub</b>.</p>

            <p>I’m testing the <b>size</b> of the game’s enemies. This orange creature is just a <b>placeholder</b>.
            <br>
			I have an idea to create a <b>dedicated</b> website just for the game’s DevLog. I think I’m going to do it.</p>

            <p>We will now have a <b>trampoline</b> in the game. This will help the player reach places that they normally wouldn’t be able to access. It will require some testing to see if this mechanic works well for the game.
			I’m also planning to add an <b>inverted</b> gravity mechanic, similar to the one in <b>VVVVVV</b>, but I’m not sure yet if this will be a good idea.</p>

            <p>I’m currently working on a game project called <b>HWT550</b>. I can’t share many details about it yet, but what I can say is that it will be a platformer 100% inspired by the game <b>VVVVVV</b>, and it will also be the first original game from my company, <a href="https://guaximix.itch.io/">Guaximix</a>.</p>
